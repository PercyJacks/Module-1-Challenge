## HTML CSS Git Challenge: Code Refactor

This HTML CSS Git Challenge is a representation of how important search engine optimization is. It also demonstrates good code practices.

# Challenges

The main challenge was getting into a web design mindset. In order to correctly assign semantic tags to divs, you needed to first view the layout of the website and group things correctly.
This then allows you to pick appropriate semantic tags for the various aspects of the website.
# Things I learned

I learnt how class selectors are very useful in applying changes to specific elements of your choosing. I also learnt how id tags can be used to create links to certain sections of the webpage.
Most of all, I learnt the importance of DRY code in terms of improving readability and efficiency.
